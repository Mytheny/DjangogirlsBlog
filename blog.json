Go back to the command-line and type python manage.py createsuperuser, and press enter. When prompted, type your username (lowercase, no spaces), email address, and password. Don't worry that you can't see the password you're typing in - that's how it's supposed to be. Just type it in and press enter to continue. The output should look like this (where username and email should be your own ones):\r\n\r\n(myvenv) ~/djangogirls$ python manage.py createsuperuser\r\nUsername: admin\r\nEmail address: admin@admin.com\r\nPassword:\r\nPassword (again):\r\nSuperuser created successfully.\r\nReturn to your browser. Log in with the superuser's credentials you chose; you should see the Django admin dashboard.\r\n\r\nDjango admin\r\n\r\nGo to Posts and experiment a little bit with it. Add five or six blog posts. Don't worry about the content - you can simply copy-paste some text from this tutorial to save time :).\r\n\r\nMake sure that at least two or three posts (but not all) have the publish date set. It will be helpful later",
